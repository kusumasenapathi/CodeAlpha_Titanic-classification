# Titanic classification
**Overview**
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing the Titanic dataset, we build and evaluate models to classify whether a passenger survived or not based on various features such as age, sex, passenger class, and more.

**Features**
* Data preprocessing and feature engineering
* Multiple classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests)
* Model evaluation and comparison
* Visualizations for data analysis and model performance
**Usage**
* Data Preparation
* The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle. Download the train.csv and test.csv files and place them in the data directory.


**Description** 
* Make a system which tells whether the person will be save from sinking.
* Importing Libraries: Import necessary libraries. These include Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical operations, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, and scikit-learn for machine learning tasks.
* Loading Dataset: Load the Titanic dataset from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
*  Display the data, handling the missing values,
*  Dropping Column: Check if the 'Cabin' column exists in the dataset. If it does, drop the 'Cabin' column due to many missing values.
*  Feature Selection: Define the features (X) and the target variable (y) for the machine learning model.
*  The features include columns such as 'Pclass', 'Age', 'SibSp', etc., and the target variable is 'Survived'.
*   Data standarization and prediction also in it.
